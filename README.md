# Funding Circle Tech Test

Write a program that calculates and prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 calculated prime numbers.

## Requirements

* The program must run from the command line and print to screen 1 table.
* Across the top and down the left side should be the 10 primes, and the body of the table should contain the product of multiplying these numbers.
* Please include tests.
* Think about cases where the code doesn't know the upper limit (maybe it's 30 and not 10 primes?)
* Think about code complexity.
* Don't use the Ruby prime method.
* Impress me :-)
